## Outreach Strategy Notes

**Per Swapnil's direction:**

1. **Don't expect replies** — follow up 2-3 times per contact
2. **Multiple people per company** — email licensing team, then partnerships, then executives
3. **LinkedIn in parallel** — find the licensing/partnerships lead on LinkedIn, send connection request + short note
4. **No AI positioning** — every email above says "media monitoring product", nothing about AI
5. **Track everything** — log each outreach, response, and follow-up in action-log.json

**Outreach order (recommended):**

| Priority | Target | Why First |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Associated Press | Licensing is their business — highest reply probability |
| 2 | Dow Jones/Factiva | Established licensing program, commercial path is clear |
| 3 | Thomson Reuters/LSEG | News API exists, they sell to monitoring companies already |
| 4 | Axel Springer | BI + Politico, known to work with tech companies |
| 5 | NBCUniversal | Large portfolio, one deal = 5 outlets |
| 6 | FT (Nikkei) | Known licensing programs |
| 7 | Economist Group | Known licensing through EIU |
| 8 | Bloomberg | Most selective — approach after learning from others |
| 9 | Cision/PRNewswire | Competitor-owned — approach last, carefully |

**Pending blocker:** Need Qodex domain email from Siddhant before sending any of these.
