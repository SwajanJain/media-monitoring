## Consultant Synthesis: Current Market Gaps
- Trust wedge: transparent pricing, cancellation, and renewal policies (anti-trap) are still a core differentiator.
- Signal wedge: teams still want 'what matters and why' rather than more mentions; prioritization + narrative clarity remains underserved.
- Coverage wedge: measurable recall/coverage quality and credible paywall/licensing strategy remain persistent gaps.
- Workflow wedge: reporting/export and day-to-day UX still cause teams to stitch together tools and manual work.

- This report is based on rule-based topic detection; it is designed to be explainable and auditable against the thread index.
