# Swapnil (CEO) Meeting Context — Media Monitoring Expansion

> This is the living context document. It captures the CEO's direction, what we're working on, and decisions made along the way. Updated as the project evolves.

## Meeting Summary (Swapnil Direction)

The CEO is exploring **expanding into Media Monitoring for Brands** as a new product line, adjacent to our existing alumni news monitoring capabilities.

### What "Media Monitoring for Brands" Means

Brands (e.g., Amazon) want to:
- Track where their name appears across **news + social media**
- Analyze **positive vs negative sentiment**
- Understand **what topics** are being discussed about them
- Know **which outlets and regions** give good or bad coverage

This is a **crowded, mature market** with established incumbents.

---

## Key Competitors Identified

| Competitor | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Meltwater** | Big, complex, enterprise-grade |
| **Cision** | Major player, bundled PR + monitoring |
| **Muck Rack** | Strong in journalist/PR space |
| 2–3 others TBD | To be identified during research |

These companies typically sell **bundled products**, not just monitoring:
- PR outreach (journalist databases + pitching)
- Media monitoring (brand mentions in news)
- Social media listening / response

**CEO's directive: Focus only on Media Monitoring for now. Not the full PR suite.**

---

## The Core Question

> "Can we compete in Media Monitoring, given established players, our current ~50% capability, and the gaps we'd need to close?"

This is a **discovery + competitive intelligence task**, not execution yet.

---

## Assigned Workstreams

### A. Competitive Product Research (non-negotiable)

Deeply understand competitors' products:

1. Identify key competitors (Meltwater, Cision, Muck Rack + 2–3 others)
2. Request product demos (use alternate/dummy email if needed)
3. For each demo, document:
   - Core features
   - Data sources (news, blogs, social, licensed content?)
   - Coverage depth (regions, languages)
   - Filters (time, sentiment, outlets, etc.)
   - Reporting and dashboards
   - Obvious strengths
   - Obvious gaps/weaknesses

**Expected output:** Comparative feature + capability breakdown.

### B. Media Partnerships Exploration

Critical question: **How do incumbents get access to premium/paywalled content?**

Tasks:
- Investigate whether platforms license content, use partnerships, or rely on public feeds
- Reach out to media houses (especially paywalled business journals — international + Indian)
- Understand licensing models, willingness to partner, commercial constraints

**This is exploratory — not to close deals yet.**

### C. Outreach & Persistence

Swapnil's explicit philosophy:
- Don't expect replies immediately
- Be persistent — reach out to employees, multiple people in same company, even executives
- Use LinkedIn + email
- Use AI to draft emails if needed
- Expect low response rates initially
- Volume + patience over elegance

### D. Positioning Constraint (very important)

> **Do NOT complicate this with AI positioning.**

- Don't pitch as "AI media intelligence"
- Don't use buzzwords
- Position simply as: **"Media Monitoring Product"**
- Especially important when talking to business journals, media houses, traditional players

This is a **deliberate positioning decision** from the CEO.

## What Swapnil Implicitly Expects

1. **Identify exactly what our 50% capability is** — what we already have
2. **Identify the missing 50%** — feature gaps, data gaps, partnerships needed
3. **Answer: "What will it take for us to compete?"** — complexity vs payoff
4. **Regular updates** — light updates while working, structured update on Friday

---

## Open/Ambiguous Questions (to clarify later)

These are not resolved yet — keep in mind but don't block on them:

| Question | Options | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Success criteria | Go/no-go decision vs "build MVP no matter what"? | Unresolved |
| Target customer | Enterprise only? Mid-market? India vs global? | Unresolved |
| Depth vs breadth | Best-in-class monitoring vs "good enough" bundled offering? | Unresolved |

---

## One-Line Summary

> "Do a ground-level, demo-driven teardown of the media monitoring market, understand competitors and data partnerships, and assess whether our existing capabilities can realistically be extended to compete — without AI hype."

---

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Made By |
|---|---|---|
| — | Focus on Media Monitoring only, not full PR suite | Swapnil |
| — | No AI positioning — keep it simple | Swapnil |
| — | Discovery phase first, not execution | Swapnil |
